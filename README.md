# EGA-QuickView

EGA-QuickView is a FUSE file system to access EGA files remotely. It
works on Linux and macOS 12.  (macOS 11 has
[bugs](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/779#issuecomment-772890544),
and on M1, [it seems you need to run in "reduced security mode",
otherwise third-party kernel extensions cannot be
loaded](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/779#issuecomment-801761709)).

From the [libfuse description](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/master/README.md):

> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface for userspace
> programs to export a filesystem to the Linux kernel. The FUSE
> project consists of two components: the fuse kernel module
> (maintained in the regular kernel repositories) and the libfuse
> userspace library (maintained in [this repository](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)). libfuse provides
> the reference implementation for communicating with the FUSE kernel
> module.

EGA-QuickView is a combination of sshfs and crypt4ghfs. That is, we
communicate with the EGA distribution servers over ssh, download files
(chunk by chunk) in Crypt4GH format and decrypt them transparently.

It is useful for a user to quickly browse through a file, without
downloading it entirely before being able to open it. It looses its
purpose if the user plans on scanning the entire file. For that
latter, it is more appropriate to download the files using the Aspera
solution, and decrypt the files locally with [Crypt4GH](https://crypt4gh.readthedocs.io).

## Installation

We need a few required packages (gcc, make, libsodium, libfuse, autoconf...)

    # On Linux (Debian-like)
	apt install libfuse3-dev autoconf gcc make pkg-config libsodium-dev libssl-dev libglib2.0-dev

    # On macOS
	brew install macfuse autoconf automake gcc make pkg-config libsodium openssl@1.1 glib


You can then compile the EGA-qv code with:

	autoreconf -i
	./configure
	make

On macOS, you might need to call `./configure --with-openssl=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)` instead, if you can't find Openssl.

## Example

EGA-QuickView works over SSH and uses Crypt4GH. It therefore needs a Crypt4GH-compatible key.
2 arguments are required: the location of the EGA server and a mountpoint.
Credentials to connect to the EGA server can be passed similarly to a classic SSH connection.
The Crypt4GH key must be passed as a `-o` argument, in the options list.

	ega-qv [options] <EGA-server> <mountpoint>
	
For example, the user `silverdaz` can connect to `outbox.ega-archive.org`, using:

	ega-qv -o seckey=~/.ssh/c4gh.key silverdaz@outbox.ega-archive.org ~/EGA
	
You will get prompted for the Crypt4GH passphrase (and eventually your
password to connect to the server, unless you used an ssh-key
(recommended)).

## Todo

- [ ] Create documentation on ReadTheDocs
- [ ] Remove the passphrase prompt if the key is not locked (Not recommended).
